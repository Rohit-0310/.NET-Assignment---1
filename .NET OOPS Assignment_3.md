# Assignment: Library Management System

# Objective:

# Create a simple Library Management System using C# OOP concepts to manage books and users.

Requirements:

1. Define a `Book `Class

   Properties:

```C#
BookID (int)
Title (string)
Author (string)
IsAvailable (bool, default: true)
```
Constructor: Initialize all properties.
Method:

```C# 
DisplayBookDetails(): Prints book details.
```






2. Define a `User` Class

Properties:
```C#
UserID (int)
Name (string)
BorrowedBookID (int, default: 1, meaning no book borrowed)
```

Constructor: Initialize all properties.
Methods:
`DisplayUserDetails()`: Prints user details.




3. Define a Library Class
Properties:

`Books` (List of `Book` objects)
`Users` (List of `User` objects)
Methods:

`AddBook(Book book)`: Adds a book to the library.
`AddUser(User user)`: Adds a user to the library.
`BorrowBook(int userID, int bookID)`:
If the book is available, assign it to the user and mark it as unavailable.
`ReturnBook(int userID)`:

If the user has a borrowed book, mark it as available again. 






4. Implement Polymorphism using Method Overloading
Overload the `DisplayBookDetails()` method:
One version prints basic details (`BookID`, `Title`, `Author`).
Another version includes availability status. 






5. Implement Inheritance
Create a subclass `PremiumUser` that inherits from User:

Additional property: `MembershipLevel` (string).
Override `DisplayUserDetails()` to include membership level. 

6. Create a Console Application (`Main` Method)

Add a few books and users.
Demonstrate borrowing and returning books.
Print details of books and users before and after operations.


Expected Output Example:
```C#
Book Added: [ID: 101, Title: "C# Basics", Author: "John Doe"]
User Added: [ID: 1, Name: "Alice"]

Alice borrowed "C# Basics".
Book Status: Not Available

Alice returned "C# Basics".
Book Status: Available
```
