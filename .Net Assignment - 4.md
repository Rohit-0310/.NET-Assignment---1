# Section 1: Basic Questions
1. What are the different types of loops in C#?

Ans: - The different types of loops in C# are :-
        For loop,foreach,while,do

2. Explain the syntax and working of the for loop in C#.

```C#
    for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){

    }
```
 for loop work same as other loop it will exicute till the condition is true.
 For loop chech the condition on every execution of the loop.



3. How does a while loop work?

```C#
    while(true) {

    }
```

.While loop also works same as other loop it will exicute the block of code until the condition is true
If we inilisize the condition false then loop will not exicute the block of code.


4. What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

While loop chech the condition before the execution of a while loop built
Do-While loop chech the condition after the execution

```C#
while (true){
    Console.WriteLine("Hello")
}

do{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World !!!")
}while (true)

```



5. What happens if the loop condition in a while loop is initially false?

When loop condition in a while loop is initially false then loop never exicute the loop condition.

6. How do you use a foreach loop in C#?

foreach loop is use to itrate over each elements in collections

```C#
foreach (int item in collections){
    
}
```


7. Can we modify elements inside a foreach loop? Why or why not?

No we can modify the elements inside foreach in C#.
Because foreach loop provide a read-only referance to the elements in the collection


# Section 2: Intermediate Questions

8. What is an infinite loop? Provide examples using for, while, and do-while.

An infinite loop is means that never terminates because there condition never satisfies.
```C#
for (int i = 0; i >=0; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine("infinite Loop.......");
}
```

```C#
while (true) {
    Console.WriteLine("infinite Loop.......");
}
```

```C#
do{
    Console.WriteLine("infinite Loop.......");
}while(true);
```

9. How does the break statement work inside loops?

Break statements is use to immediately exit from loop.

```C#
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (i == 3)
    {
        break;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```
it will only print i till 2 .


10. What is the role of the continue statement in loops?

continue statements used to skip the current conditional statement.
```C#
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (i == 3)
    {
        continue;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```
it will skip 3 and print rest of the condition

11. How can you exit multiple nested loops at once?

We can use boolean flag variables with break to exit the loop.

```C#
bool exitLoops = false;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
        for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++)
        {
            if (i == 2 && j == 3 && k == 4)
            {
                exitLoops = true;
                break;
            }
            Console.WriteLine($"i: {i}, j: {j}, k: {k}");
        }
        if (exitLoops) break;
    }
    if (exitLoops) break;
}

Console.WriteLine("Exited from nested loops.");
```

It will print till if condition after it will exit from nested loops.

12. What is the difference between break and return inside a loop?

Break will exit from loop and execute rest of the code.

```C#
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (i == 3)
    {
        break;
    }
}
Console.WriteLine("End of method");
```

Return will exits from entir method or function. 
If we use return inside the loop, it will terminate entire method itself.

```C#

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (i == 3)
    {
        return;  // Exit the immediately from the method
    }
}
Console.WriteLine("This will not be printed");


```


13. How do you iterate through an array using loops?

```C#
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]);
}
```


14. Write a C# program to find the largest and smallest number in an array using loops.


```C#
int[] arr = { 12, 32, 23, 45,4, 8, 3, 7 };

        int smallNum = arr[0];
        int largeNum = arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.Length; i++)
        {
            if (arr[i] > largeNum)
            {
                largeNum = arr[i];
            }
            if (arr[i] < smallNum)
            {
                smallNum = arr[i];
            }
        }

        Console.WriteLine($"This is Smallest number: {smallNum}");
        Console.WriteLine($"This is the Largest number: {largeNum}");
```


# Section 3: Advanced Questions
15. Can a for loop run indefinitely? If yes, how?

Yes, for loop run indefinitely

```C#
for (;;)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This for loop runs indefinitely. until we break");
}

```

16. How do you implement a loop using recursion instead of traditional looping constructs?

Yes, We can impliment a loop using recursion instead of traditional looping constructs

```C#

    void PrintNumbers(int n)
        {
            if (n >= 16) return;
            Console.WriteLine("recurtion,,,,,,,,"+n);
            PrintNumbers(n + 1);
        }

        PrintNumbers(10);
```

17. What is the impact of using goto inside loops? Is it recommended? Explain with an example.

Using goto inside loops allow us to jump to a specific location in the program

```C#

    int x = 0;

        start:
        if (x < 5)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Going to start{x}");
            x++;
            goto start;
        }
```

18. How does a foreach loop work internally in C#?

ForEach loop work in C# using enumeration interface it iterates over the collection

```C#
    int[] num = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    foreach (int n in num)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(n);
    }

```

19. Can a foreach loop be replaced with a for loop? If yes, in what cases?

Yes, we can replaced the foreach loop with a for loop if collection arr or list

```C#

    List<int> num = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    foreach (int n in num)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(n);
    }

```
Here we can access elements by indexing
```C#

    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Count; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("indexing in number " + numbers[i]);
    }

```


20. How do you optimize performance in loops when working with large datasets?

21. What are the best practices for writing efficient loops in C#?

This is the best practice for writing loop in C#.
We can use for loop for index- based iterationm.
We can Use foreach loop for readOnly iteration.
We can Use while loop for conditional iteration.


22. How does the Parallel.ForEach loop differ from a normal foreach loop? Provide an example.
