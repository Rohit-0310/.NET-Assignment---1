```C#
while (true){
    Console.WriteLine("Hello")
}

do{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World !!!")
}while (true)

```

When loop condition in a while loop is initially false then loop never exicute the loop condition.

6. How do you use a foreach loop in C#?

foreach loop is use to itrate over each elements in collections

```C#
foreach (int item in collections){
    
}
```


7. Can we modify elements inside a foreach loop? Why or why not?
